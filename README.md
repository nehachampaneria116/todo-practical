# Todo Reminder Application

This is a Node.js application that allows users to manage their Todo tasks and send email reminders for upcoming tasks. The project uses Express for the web server, Sequelize for ORM, Nodemailer for sending emails, and Node-cron for scheduling tasks.
I have done this task in javascript and can create in nestJs with typescript.
If you allow one more hour can complete nodejs with typescript as well.

## Features

- Create Todo tasks with a title, due date, reminder time, and email.
- Schedule email reminders based on the reminder time.
- Send reminder emails using Nodemailer and Gmail.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- A Gmail account for sending emails.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
